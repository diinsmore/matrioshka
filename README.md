working towards building a pseudo-terraria style game with elements of factorio & dwarf fortress. 
barring performance constraints, interstellar automation & managing a multi-planetary colony is currently the end-goal. 
regardless of how this project ultimately evolves, it should serve as an interesting experiment to push the limits of python/pygame
